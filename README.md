Welcome to Lubobalo's Sneaker Catalogue.

A project which consists of two sections, namely: the catalogue and user-support sections.

The catalogue section refers to a web page which allows you to shop for new pairs of sneakers to your liking. Here, you are able to add your chosen sneaker/sneakers to the shopping cart;
and if you're not feeling the new addition, just simply remove it from the cart. When satified; check-out your purchase and wait for your pretend shoes to be delivered.

The user support section refers to a web page which enables Lubobalo (the user admin) to manage the stock on display in the catalogue. Here, Lubobalo is able to view all shoes that are out of stock (sold out);
along with adding new shoes to the catalogue.
